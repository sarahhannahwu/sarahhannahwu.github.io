Hi, I'm Sarah! I'm a predoctoral researcher at Stanford's Social Media Lab, studying how people communicate in digitally-mediated contexts.

My background
======
Prior to working at Stanford, I earned my BA in cognitive psychology from Reed College. There, I gained hands-on research experience and conducted thesis research on people's perceptions of AI music composers. 

For fun
------
I love to play tango and classical violin! I also enjoy bouldering (extremeley statically)!
