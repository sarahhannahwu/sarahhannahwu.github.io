Hi, I'm Sarah! I'm a PhD student in the Stanford Social Media Lab, studying how people communicate in digitally-mediated contexts. Through my research, I aim to develop informed recommendations for the use of AI and social media by advancing our theoretical understanding of usage patterns and their downstream consequences. 

My background
======
Prior to starting a PhD, I completed a predoctoral research fellowship through Stanford's Institute for Research in the Social Sciences. Before that, I earned my BA in cognitive psychology and music minor from Reed College. There, I gained hands-on research experience and conducted thesis research on people's perceptions of AI music composers. At Reed, I was fortunate enough to have been supported by research mentors Kevin Holmes and Jennifer Corpus, as well as faculty in the music department who provided opportunities for me to perform and explore new music. I also had a brief stint as the Operations Manager at Peninsula Youth Orchestra, where I contributed to the organization I was privileged to be a part of during my musical upbringing.

For fun
------
I love to play tango and classical violin! Currently, I perform in an orquesta tipica and a community orchestra, and occasionally gig with other ensembles in the Bay Area. I also enjoy bouldering (extremely statically)!
