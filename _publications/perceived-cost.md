A growing body of research suggests that perceived cost, the largely neglected component of Expectancy-Value Theory, is an important predictor of achievement outcomes. However, existing studies in the cost literature focus almost exclusively on STEM domains, use short-term measures of academic outcomes, and typically rely on quantitative reports of students’ cost perceptions. The present study applied a mixed-methods approach to 1) document the relationship between first-year college students’ domain-general cost perceptions and their longerterm academic outcomes, and 2) characterize the motivational experiences of students with high versus low quantitative reports of cost.
